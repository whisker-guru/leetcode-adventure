         *  Time Complexity:
         *    In the best case scenario where the tree is balanced, each node is visited once, and each call to getHeight takes constant time O(1).
         *    Therefore, the time complexity in the best case is O(n).
         *    In the worst case scenario where the tree is highly unbalanced, the recursion will still visit each node once,
         *    resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
         *
         *  Space Complexity:
         *    In the best case scenario of a balanced tree, the maximum recursion depth is O(log n) since the tree's height is logarithmic.
         *    Therefore, the space complexity in the best case is O(log n).
         *    In the worst case scenario of a highly unbalanced tree, the recursion depth could be as deep as the number of nodes in the tree,
         *    leading to a space complexity of O(n).

         *  Time Complexity:
         *    Best Case (Balanced Tree): In a balanced binary tree, the height of the tree is O(log n).
         *      Therefore, for each of the n nodes, the isBalanced function takes O(log n) time to compute the height difference,
         *      resulting in a total time complexity of O(n * log n).
         *    Worst Case (Highly Unbalanced Tree):
         *      In the worst-case scenario where the binary tree is highly unbalancedï¼Œ the height of the tree is O(n).
         *      In this case, for each of the n nodes, the isBalanced function takes O(n) time to compute the height difference,
         *      resulting in a total time complexity of O(n^2).
         *  Space Complexity:
         *    Best Case (Balanced Tree):
         *      In a balanced binary tree, the maximum recursion depth of the isBalanced function is determined by the height of the tree,
         *      which is O(log n). This results in a space complexity of O(log n) because the space used on the system stack is proportional
         *      to the height of the tree.
         *    Worst Case (Highly Unbalanced Tree):
         *      In the worst-case scenario where the binary tree is highly unbalanced, the maximum recursion depth of the isBalanced
         *      function can be O(n). This occurs when the tree resembles a linked list. In such a case, the space complexity would be O(n)
         *      because the height of the system stack would grow linearly with the number of nodes in the tree.
