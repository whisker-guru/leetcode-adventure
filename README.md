# LeetCode Adventure

## Introduction
This repository will serve as my personal journal, documenting my daily coding practice and growth.

## Strategy
1. I've started solving LeetCode problems from the recommended 169 questions on the website：[Tech Interview Handbook - Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75). I've dedicated 10 hours per week to solving problems, aiming to complete all the exercises within a four-month timeframe.

2. Before starting the study plan, I've set a few principles to ensure efficiency and high-quality practice.
    - If I can't come up with a solution within three minutes, I'll learn from others' answers instead of getting stuck.
    - Analyze the complexity of each problem, and learn to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different algorithms.
    - It's important to create meaningful test cases for validation without prematurely submitting answers.
    - I'll prioritize understanding over extensive note-taking, jotting down only key concepts.
    - Skipping practice daily is fine, but I won't let more than 72 hours pass without tackling a LeetCode problem—I refuse to let laziness creep in!

3. After completing the first round, I'll challenge myself to solve the problems again without referring to the answers.

## Milestones
- **2024/02/17:** Embarked on my LeetCode journey, with the aim of completing the first round of Grind169 within four months.
