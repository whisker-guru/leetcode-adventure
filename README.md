# LeetCode Adventure

## About
Welcome to my LeetCode journey, where I'm diving into the world of coding challenges and sharing all the ups and downs along the way.

## Strategy:
1. I've picked out a bunch of problems from the awesome [Tech Interview Handbook - Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) site. I'm committing 10 hours a week to crack these puzzles, aiming to conquer 169 of them over the next four months.

2. Before starting the study plan, I've set a few principles to ensure effectiveness:
    - If I'm stuck for more than three minutes, I'm not sweating it. I'll check out how others cracked it instead of banging my head against the wall.
    - I'll keep a close eye on time and complexity, analyzing various solution methods.
    - It's important to create meaningful test cases for validation without prematurely submitting answers.
    - I'll prioritize understanding over extensive note-taking, jotting down only key concepts.
    - Feel free to take breaks from daily practice, but I'll make sure I don't let more than 72 hours pass without working on a LeetCode problem

3. After completing the first round, I'll challenge myself to solve the problems again without referring to the answers.

## Milestones:
- **2024/02/17:** Kicked off this wild ride, aiming to conquer the first 169 problems in four monthsã€‚
